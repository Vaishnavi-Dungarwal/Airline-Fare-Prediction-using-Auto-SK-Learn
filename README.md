Flight Fare Prediction using Auto SK Learn

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict flight fares based on various input attributes. We will first employ traditional machine learning techniques to create a predictive model, and then explore the power of Auto SK Learn, an AutoML library, to automate the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.


Context -
Flight ticket prices are known to be highly unpredictable and can vary significantly from day to day. To address this challenge, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict flight fares based on relevant attributes. The dataset contains flight ticket prices for various airlines between March and June 2019, considering different cities.


Notebook Contents - 
1. Data Analysis: In this step, we will perform exploratory data analysis on the flight fare dataset. This involves visualizing data distributions, identifying trends, and gaining insights into the relationship between different attributes and flight fares.
2. Feature Engineering: To improve the model's predictive power, we will perform feature engineering, including data transformation, handling missing values, and creating new relevant features.
3. Feature Selection: We will select the most informative and relevant features to reduce model complexity and improve performance.
4. Model Building using ML: We will utilize traditional machine learning techniques to build predictive models. Algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting will be trained and evaluated on the dataset.
5. Model Building using Auto SK Learn (Auto ML): In this step, we will explore Auto SK Learn, an AutoML library. Auto SK Learn will automatically search for the best model architecture and tune hyperparameters to find the optimal model for flight fare prediction.
